\chapter{Implementation Plan}
The following are considerations for the remainder of the project.

\section{Construction Methods}
%3D Print? Colours? 


\section{Material}
It is important to consider the material the rods and the board will be made from; the users of the product are young children, and so the durability of the product should reflect that. It should also be 

\section{Contacts and Wire}



\section{Wireless Communication}
The board will need to transmit information about the rod placements (as well as some other auxiliary information such as remaining battery power) to the server to be processed by the software. This will likely be achieved using an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, a popular choice for wireless communications in projects of this nature. The author is currently studying the Embedded Systems module offered in EEE, during which the use of the ESP8266 module is taught, and so more detailed plans will be realised once the course is completed.

\section{Power}
The board will be battery powered, so research will need to be performed into the size and type of battery required to sustain the board for a reasonable amount of usage. What 'reasonable' constitutes will be determined by future conversations with teachers. Thought will have to go into how a charging interface may be designed; it could be powered from the mains, but an adapter will need to be incorporated to bring the voltage to an appropriate level, or it could be powered via a USB port, which could reduce complexity but may not be as convenient as the wall socket.



\section{Additional Interfaces}
It may be of use to include additional interfaces such as buttons, switches and an LCD screen or 7-segment display. These may not serve any purpose when the product is first put into production, but would serve as an available resource to be used when software is updated in the future. It would also give the flexibility of allowing us to add functionality nearing the end of this design cycle through the relatively easy task of writing extra code. rather than the less-easily accomplished task of redesigning and rebuilding hardware. This would, however, increase material costs, which will be taken into account when making the final decision.
